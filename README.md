# PaleoPredictive-Modelling
PaleoPredictive Modelling leverages machine learning to enhance fossil species classification by addressing the challenges of incomplete and biased fossil records. This project develops predictive models that analyse skeletal measurements and other data to provide new insights into extinct species.
